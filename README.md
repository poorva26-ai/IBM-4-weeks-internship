# ⚖️ Capstone Project – Tele-Law Legal Aid Disparity Analysis

> **Title**: *Analyzing Demographic and Regional Disparities in Tele-Law Case Registrations for Inclusive Legal Access*

This project focuses on analyzing the **inclusivity and accessibility** of India's Tele-Law services. Using machine learning and cloud-based analytics, we identify disparities in access to legal aid based on gender, caste, and region.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

Despite the rollout of Tele-Law services, not all communities benefit equally. The goal of this project is to analyze:

- Gender-wise usage patterns
- Caste-based representation (SC/ST/OBC/General)
- Regional disparities across districts and states

These insights aim to help policymakers **enhance outreach** and improve **legal access equity**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

There is **limited visibility** into which groups benefit most (or least) from Tele-Law services. CSC distribution, population diversity, and social barriers make it difficult to assess fairness in legal aid delivery.

The challenge: **Analyze official Tele-Law case registration data** to identify who is being underserved and why.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A data science pipeline was implemented using **IBM Cloud and AI tools** to:

- Collect and clean registration data
- Normalize counts based on CSC availability
- Apply regression to discover trends and inequities
- Visualize findings for better understanding

---

### ✅ Workflow Highlights

1. **Data Source**  
   [Gov dataset: 2021–2025 Tele-Law Registrations](https://www.data.gov.in/resource/district-wise-tele-law-case-registration-and-advice-enabled-data-fy-2021-22-2024-25)

2. **Tools & Cloud Platform**  
   - IBM Watson Studio  
   - IBM Cloud Object Storage  
   - Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
   - Jupyter Notebook  

3. **Model**  
   - Linear Regression to predict registrations based on:
     - Gender ratio
     - Caste distribution
     - Number of CSCs per region

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - R² Score  
   - RMSE & MAE  
   - Disparity patterns vs. national averages

5. **Visualization Tools**  
   - `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `geopandas`

---

## 📊 Results & Key Insights

- **Gender Disparity**: Men are significantly more represented in most regions.
- **Caste Gap**: SC/ST categories show lower registration numbers despite need.
- **Regional Inequality**: Several districts have low participation despite CSC presence.

These insights help target awareness campaigns and resource deployment more efficiently.
